Featured projects

BorrowChecker: A play on the same concept in Rust, this is a simple web-app that allows you to split complex receipts with multiple people in a simple manner. Runs entirely in-browser. Made with Dioxus and Rust. Repository link.
PowerPointSnap: A mostly feature complete tool for PowerPoint on VBA that is filled with a lot of tricks to make it easy to consistently format presentations to impress clients - from my consulting days. Written in VBA. See accompanying blog post.

Other work or contributions

IntelligentReceiptSplitter: A relatively simple predecessor to BorrowChecker that focussed on using an OCR framework followed by an LLM based parser to read receipts that could be further split manually. This combination significantly reduced hallucinations from LLMs but was still very computationally intensive to run.
r.data.table.funs: A very small set of R functions that use data.table, that I found very useful earlier in my career to quicky churn out analyses. It is not ground-breaking, but rather something that anybody with sufficient basic skills in R and understand, and save an immense amount of time.
I wrote several chapters of the Polars Book, which have since been moved to the main Polars repository. Polars was a breadth of fresh air in terms of speed and ergonomics, which I had been sorely missing after switching to Python from R (where projects like data.table and dplyr dominated), so I was eager to make it better for everybody making the switch.
