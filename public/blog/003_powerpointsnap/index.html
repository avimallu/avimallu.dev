When I worked in healthcare consulting, I often spent a LOT of my time creating PowerPoint presentations (decks in consulting lingo - not even slide decks). However, it was rather repetitive. Thus, was born PowerPointSnap.
What is it?
I&rsquo;ll write this down as pointers.

It&rsquo;s a VBA based PowerPoint add-on. Just a set of commands that work well with each other.
It&rsquo;s Windows only - it&rsquo;s unlikely to work on MacOS.
It&rsquo;s installation-free and is not an executable, which makes it perfect for locked-down corporate environments, as long as you have the permission to download files.

How do I get it?
The project is available on this Github repo. The instructions to install it are available there, but here&rsquo;s the down-low:"><meta name=author content="Avinash Mallya"><meta name=keywords content="powerpoint,ppt,vba,"><meta property="og:url" content="https://avimallu.dev/blog/003_powerpointsnap/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="Avinash's Blog"><meta property="og:title" content="Quick hacks to make client-ready presentations"><meta property="og:description" content="Premise When I worked in healthcare consulting, I often spent a LOT of my time creating PowerPoint presentations (decks in consulting lingo - not even slide decks).

The instructions to install it are available there, but here&rsquo;s the down-low:</p><ol><li>Download the Snap.ppam file to your system.</li><li>Enable the developer options.</li><li>Go to the Developer tab, and click on PowerPoint Add-ins.</li><li>Click on Add New. Choose the location of the file you just dowloaded. Click Close.</li><li>To uninstall, repeat the process, and simply click on Remove this time.</li></ol><h1 id=what-can-i-do-with-it>What can I do with it?</h1><p>Frankly, a LOT. The base concept of this tool is:</p><ol><li>&ldquo;Set&rdquo; a shape as the one you want to copy a property from.</li><li>Select any property from the list to automatically apply it.</li></ol><p>Here&rsquo;s a non-exhaustive list of all the options available.</p><h2 id=apply-properties-of-shapes-directly>Apply properties of shapes directly</h2><p>This is the part of the interface that can be used for shapes (which include charts and tables).</p><p><img src=/blog/003_powerpointsnap/01_Shapes.png alt="The UI for copying shape properties"></p><p>To use, first select a <em>shape</em> object, click on &ldquo;Set&rdquo;. Then, choose the object you want to <em>Snap</em> its properties to (see how I got the inspiration for the name?). You should be able to copy all compatible properties - if something is not copy-able, the tool will show an error, and then let you exit.</p><p>Note that it&rsquo;s probably not to apply a property of a shape to a table - if you want to make the entire table orange, there are probably better built-in ways to do it than to use <em>Snap</em>.</p><h2 id=beautify-charts-with-snappable-properties>Beautify charts with <em>Snap</em>pable properties</h2><p>Charts are also supported, with dedicated features for it.</p><p><img src=/blog/003_powerpointsnap/02_Charts.png alt="The UI for copying chart properties"></p><p>What do these features do? You should be able to hover over the option and get a tooltip that shows what it&rsquo;s capable of, but here&rsquo;s another summary just in case:</p><ol><li>Sync Value/Date Axis: this will try to align the range, the ticks, the numeric values etc. of the &ldquo;set&rdquo; chart to the one you&rsquo;ve selected. I couldn&rsquo;t put in just $x$ and $y$ here because Microsoft internally doesn&rsquo;t label them that way. Try either of these two options (you can undo!) and see what works best for your chart. This doesn&rsquo;t work well yet for 3D charts.</li><li>Sync Plot/Title/Legend: often, you want to centre a title, or make sure that multiple charts that show nearly identical things for different variables all <em>look</em> exactly the same from a client perspective. But that&rsquo;s usually difficult if you&rsquo;ve already configured the charts a little - which can be remedied with this option!</li><li>Format Painter: this is simply a helper for the normal format painter to align the formats of the text that you&rsquo;ve selected with the way it originally is in the &ldquo;set&rdquo; chart. The reason for this feature is simply to avoid going back to <em>Home</em> to click on the <em>Format Painter</em> option again.</li><li>Reset Axes Scales: in case you messed up somewhere, you can use this to rever to PowerPoint defaults.</li></ol><p>The next two options deserve their own section.</p><h2 id=customize-the-labels-programmatically>Customize the labels programmatically</h2><p>Your immediate senior in a consulting environment would frown at your chart, and then exclaim, &ldquo;I think that&rsquo;s too many labels for the data points. Can you show them every two/three/four labels? I know this is manual work, but it&rsquo;s a one time thing!&rdquo;</p><p>It&rsquo;s <strong>never</strong> a one time affair. But don&rsquo;t worry, we have this nice feature to help us. If you click on the <em>Customize Label</em> option, you will get this (without the &ldquo;Set&rdquo; option):</p><p><img src=/blog/003_powerpointsnap/DataLabelsScreenshot.JPG alt="The UI for customizing labels."></p><p>Never mind the rather unfriendly legend entries. They&rsquo;re just here to demonstrate that you can do the following kinds of whacky abilities with your own chart!</p><h3 id=screenshots-of-the-chart-snapability>Screenshots of the chart <em>snap</em>ability</h3><p>Of course, visuals will do it more justice. For example, look at this image:</p><p><img src=/blog/003_powerpointsnap/Revenue_Presentation_1.png alt="There’s a lot wrong with this image. But primarily, the charts are of different sizes, the axes are different, the labels are too clustered, and the titles aren’t centered."></p><p>Here&rsquo;s what you can do:</p><ol><li>Click on the left chart. Press &ldquo;Set&rdquo; in the toolbar for <em>Snap</em>.</li><li>Click on the right chart, and then go through the following:<ol><li>In <em>Shapes</em>, click on <em>Dim</em>. This will align the shapes of the chart.</li><li>Use the guides that you get while moving the chart to align the positions of the two charts now that their shapes are equal.</li><li>You&rsquo;ll notice that the chart area doesn&rsquo;t still match, nor does the title.</li><li>In <em>Charts</em>, click on <em>Sync Plot Area</em> and <em>Sync Title Area</em>, and watch the magic unfold.</li><li>Now, click on the second chart, and click on &ldquo;Set&rdquo;. Let&rsquo;s align the axes of the first chart to the second one.</li><li>Click on the first chart, and then in <em>Charts</em>, click <em>Sync Value Axis</em>.</li></ol></li><li>Let&rsquo;s bring that senior&rsquo;s exclamation back into play - (s)he wants you to highlight <em>only</em> Profit labels, and that too every 2 iterations. To do this:<ol><li>Click on <em>Customize Labels</em> after clicking on either chart.</li><li>You&rsquo;ll get the screen shown in the previous section. Make sure to adjust the values such that it&rsquo;s exactly like the screenshot there.</li><li>Click on &ldquo;Save and Run&rdquo;. This will <em>save</em> the configuration you&rsquo;ve selected, and <em>run</em> it on the chart you&rsquo;ve selected.</li><li>Click the other chart. Then, in <em>Charts</em>, click on <em>Rerun Customization</em>.</li></ol></li></ol><p>This is what your results should look like:</p><p><img src=/blog/003_powerpointsnap/Revenue_Presentation_2.png alt="Everything almost consistent. Your senior rests their eyes, and secretly wonder how you managed to do it quickly… maybe they should change some requirements…"></p><p>Of course, getting those calculations right is a whole different thing that will need some work.</p><h2 id=align-table-dimensions>Align table dimensions</h2><p>Oftentimes, you have two tables that show similar values&mldr; you know the drill. Here&rsquo;s what you can do in a scenario such as this:</p><p><img src=/blog/003_powerpointsnap/Table_Presentation_1.png alt="Similar data, but vastly different tables."></p><p>This is what the <em>Tables</em> section of the tool looks like:</p><p><img src=/blog/003_powerpointsnap/03_Tables.png alt="The UI for Tables"></p><p>To align these tables together,</p><ol><li>Click on the left table. Press &ldquo;Set&rdquo; in the toolbar for <em>Snap</em>.</li><li>Click on the right table.</li><li>Click on <em>Shapes</em>, inside it, <em>Dim</em>. Now the shapes of the table are the same.</li><li>In <em>Tables</em>, click on <em>Sync Column Widths</em>. Now the columns are also the same.</li><li>If you try to align by rows, it fails because the number of rows are not the same in the two tables.</li></ol><p>Here&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;ll end up with:</p><p><img src=/blog/003_powerpointsnap/Table_Presentation_2.png alt="Similar data, and similar enough tables."></p><p>Pretty neat, eh?</p></content><p><a class=blog-tags href=/tags/powerpoint/>#powerpoint</a>
