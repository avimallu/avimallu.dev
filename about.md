Hi there! 

My name is Avinash Mallya (pronounced Uh-vin-ash Mul-yeah), and I'm a Data Scientist at [WISEcode](https://www.wisecode.ai/). This is my personal blog where I post about some creative ways that I've solved some complex problems in my career, usually with a solid amount of code to make sure that it's helpful for you.

In my free time, I'm involved in helping folks out at my favourite open-source package repositories, namely [Polars](https://github.com/pola-rs/polars/) and [`data.table`](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table). In fact - I've written [some parts](https://pola-rs.github.io/polars-book/user-guide/) of the Polars user-guide.

You can connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/avinash-mallya), or [Github](https://github.com/avimallu). The source code for this website can be found at its [repo on my Github](https://github.com/avimallu/avimallu.github.io) as well. You'll also find source code in the form of text files, Jupyter Notebooks, or R Markdown files on my Github profile.
